		Hello! My name is Austin. I'm a grad student at The University of Hawaii at Manoa. <br />If someday I'm even 10% as cool as this lady above, I can die a happy camper. <br /> <br />
		As an LGBTQ+ individual myself, I wanted to create a resource that will help everyone in Hawaii and beyond become more knowledgeable and supportive of both themselves and those around them. <br />
		Thank you for visiting my site! <br /> <br /> <br /> 

		Please feel free to contact me at "hi.lgbtqpride@gmail.com" with any feedback or website suggestions.
